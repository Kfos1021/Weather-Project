California Precipitation Analysis

This project analyzes precipitation in California from the periods 2011-2017, a period classified as a drought, and 2017-2024, the period following.

Data:
The data used is the daily preciptiation taken from the San Francisco Internation Airport. This data is stored in the file nums2011-2024.csv.

Scripts:
Scripts creates three vectors: years, the average daily precipitation each year, and the total preciptation each year.

Graphs:
There are two graphs to analyze: a graph of average daily precipitation and the total precipitation. The graphs provide a visual that shows that precipitiation levels largely didn't change across the Bay Area during these two periods
